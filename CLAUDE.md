# Claude Guidance: SCRIBE Methodology Repository

## Repository Overview

**What**: This repository demonstrates and documents the **SCRIBE methodology** — a specification-first development approach for AI-assisted software development. The SCRIBE doctrine is the primary purpose of this repository.

**Why**: To provide a canonical reference implementation of SCRIBE, showing how a technology-specific Speculator (in this case, the API Speculator) drives the entire development lifecycle — from natural language project description through to tested, production-ready code.

**What This Repo Is NOT**: This is not primarily a Hello World API project. The Hello World API (`/src`, `/tests`) is a *product* of the SCRIBE methodology — a working example generated by following the doctrine. The methodology is the point; the API is merely the illustration.

## The SCRIBE Doctrine

The full SCRIBE methodology is documented in **[README.md](./README.md)**. Read it to understand the context of everything in this repository.

SCRIBE stands for: **S**pecification → **C**apture → **R**efinement → **I**mplementation → **B**uild → **E**xecution

## How This Repository Works: The Two-Prompt Flow

This repository demonstrates a two-prompt execution model. No source code exists until both prompts have been executed:

### Prompt 1: The API Speculator
**File**: [API-SPECULATOR.md](./API-SPECULATOR.md)

Execute this file as a prompt in Claude Code. It:
1. Asks structured questions to capture all project requirements (the **Capture** phase)
2. Generates 11+ markdown specification files (the **Specification** phase)
3. Among those files is `API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` — the second prompt

No source code is generated at this stage. Only markdown specifications exist.

### Prompt 2: The Implementation Prompt
**File**: [API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md](./API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md)

Execute this file as a prompt in Claude Code *after* specifications have been reviewed and refined. It:
1. Reads all specification markdown files
2. Generates `/src` — complete implementation code
3. Generates `/tests` — comprehensive test suite
4. Compiles and runs all tests (the **Build** phase)
5. Generates `API-CLAUDE.md` — Claude agent guidance specific to the generated project

Only after this prompt is executed does source code exist in the repository.

---

## The Generated Agent Guidance File

When `API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` is executed, it generates **`API-CLAUDE.md`** as its final output. This file contains Claude Code agent guidance *specific to the generated Hello World API project* — build commands, coding standards, endpoint workflows, gotchas, and links to the `/docs/` specifications.

**`API-CLAUDE.md` is the implementation-scoped equivalent of this file.** Consult it when working on the generated source code in `/src` and `/tests`.

| File | Scope | Created by |
|------|-------|------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | SCRIBE methodology & repository | Hand-authored (permanent) |
| `API-CLAUDE.md` | Generated Hello World API code | `API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` (regeneratable) |

## Key Files in This Repository

### Methodology
- **[README.md](./README.md)** — The full SCRIBE doctrine (primary document)
- **[docs/SCRIBE-METHODOLOGY.md](./docs/SCRIBE-METHODOLOGY.md)** — Source of the SCRIBE methodology document

### Speculators
- **[API-SPECULATOR.md](./API-SPECULATOR.md)** — The API Speculator prompt; execute this to begin the SCRIBE cycle for an API project

### Generated by API-SPECULATOR.md (specification phase)
- **[API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md](./API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md)** — The implementation prompt; execute this to generate source code
- **[docs/api/specs/](./docs/api/specs/)** — All API specifications (design, error handling, technology choices, endpoint contracts)
- **[docs/api/guides/](./docs/api/guides/)** — Procedural guides (getting started design, adding endpoints)
- **[docs/api/adr/](./docs/api/adr/)** — Architecture decision records

### Generated by API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md (implementation phase)
- **`/src/`** — Generated source code (regeneratable)
- **`/tests/`** — Generated test suite (regeneratable)
- **`API-CLAUDE.md`** — Generated Claude agent guidance for the API project (regeneratable)
- **`API-RESTORATION-PROMPT.md`** — Removes all generated artifacts, restoring to specification-only state

### Example Output Reference
- **[API-SPECULATOR-EXAMPLE-CODE-OUTPUT.md](./API-SPECULATOR-EXAMPLE-CODE-OUTPUT.md)** — Example of what the API Speculator produces

---

## Restoration and Iteration

The SCRIBE methodology is **reversible**. To return to specification-only state:

1. Execute `API-RESTORATION-PROMPT.md` as a Claude Code prompt
2. This removes `/src`, `/tests`, `API-CLAUDE.md`, and other generated artifacts
3. Only the specification markdown files remain
4. Refine specifications, then re-execute `API-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` to regenerate

This cycle can be repeated indefinitely. Specifications are permanent; code is regeneratable.
